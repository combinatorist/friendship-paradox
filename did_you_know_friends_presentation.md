# Did you know you're friends have more friends than you?
## ... but it's ok because so do they...

# Assumptions
- can we agree that Leonard isn't Sheldon's friend unless Sheldon is his friend too?

# Simple example
- ok, so Sheldon and Leonard are friends and in the beginning they don't have any other friends
- first how many friends does Sheldon have? 1
- Leonard? 1
- so how many friends do Sheldon's friends have on average? 1
- how about George's friends? 1

# less simple
- let's assume George has a friend, Monica.
- two possibilities:
  - monica is my friend too
  - or she isn't my friend
- Suppose she isn't, then George's friends, bumps up to 2
- meanwhile Monica and I each only have 1
- So, George has 2 friends and on average his friend's only have 1 friend
- but I only have one friend George and he has 2 friends
- the same is true for Monica
- so, one person - George - has more friends than his friends do,
- but most people in this group have less friends than their friends do.

# punchline
- We don't really know if you're George or not, so mostly likely (unless you're John), your friends have more friends (on average) than you do

# Resolution
- what if Monica and I become friends?
- in that case, everyone has 2 friends and everyone's friends have 2 friends, so everything's
- but that's unlikely in the real world as you include more people
- when there's already 60 people in the group will the 61st people really be friends with all of them?
- it's also possible

# Applications
- Google's page rank algorithm
- detecting and stopping epidemics

# To Do
- pick random names that nobody knows or use TV show
- create demo graphs
- incorporate the following
  - this is a mathematical property of graphs, it has nothing to do with human behavior
  - think FB: people either are friends or they aren't
  - really it's ok for half the people to have more friends than their friends on average, but no more
  - some of you will have more questions


Feedback:
- good to hear applications
- too much time on Sheldon / Penny
- speak louder
